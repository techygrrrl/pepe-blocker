## What's wrong with Pepe?

Pepe the frog has historically been used by alt-right movements to troll and harass women, people of colour, and the LGBTQ+ communities. [It is considered a hate symbol by the ADL](https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/pepe-frog), an anti-hate organization. Even the original artist has [abandoned it](https://www.thejournal.ie/pepe-frog-rip-3378042-May2017/). 


So while:

- it is often used in a positive light with the popular BetterTTV extension
- not everybody knows that this symbol is harmful
- those that know that it's harmful don't mean to use it in a harmful context

It's important to note:

- some people find these images triggering, specifically marginalized communities that are targeted by hate groups
- even without BTTV support for these emotes, the names of the emotes alone can be triggering

Blocking these terms may also be able to slow down a hate raid. It is probable that attackers will use messages with this symbol even if you don't have the BTTV support for them.
